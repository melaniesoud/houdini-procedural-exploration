# Procedural Simulation Exploration

This repository documents early exploration of motion-driven procedural systems using Houdini.

Included examples explore:

- rigid body interaction (cup shatter simulation)
- particle-based motion within constrained environments (gumball simulation)

These exercises were completed to build intuition for geometry interaction, collision behavior, and motion-driven system response.
